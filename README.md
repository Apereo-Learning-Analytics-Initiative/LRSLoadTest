LRSLoadTest
===========

Learning Record Store (LRS) load testing scripts and notes

Goals
-----
Create a series of reusable scripts (jmeter, etc.) which can be used to load test an LRS and roughly benchmark its ability to handle large numbers of incoming statements.
It is NOT our goal to test the ability of an LRS to handle incoming statements along with other processing (for UIs or data retrieval for example). This is all about data storage.
